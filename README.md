# üìö Library: VALA coding assignment.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Implementation Notes

The assignment task explicitly states that the data must be stored in a text file; otherwise, I would have used SQLite, which would simplify storing, inserting new records and performing sorting via SQL queries.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.7+

No external libraries required.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

From the terminal, run the script and pass the **library file** as the first argument:

```bash
python my_library_db.py library.txt
```

If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.

---

## üìã Task

Create a database program that store books and takes a file as the first command line
argument.

```bash
 python my_library_db.py library.txt
```

The file contains rows, which each keep information of name of book, name of the writer, ISBN
and publishing year.

E.g.
```
Idiot/Fyodor Dostoyevsky/9780850670356/1971

Moby Dick/Herman Melville/9781974305032/1981
```

After reading the file, program shows UI, where is option to

1) Add new book, 
2) Print current database content in ascending order by publishing year or
Q) Exit the program

With first option program should ask user the book‚Äôs name, writer‚Äôs name, book‚Äôs ISBN and
publishing year. Then show the results to user and ask, does user want to update the
database. If user selects to update the database program should add the new book‚Äôs
information into file given as command line input argument. And otherwise return to main
menu.
The Input file should be kept in numerical order based on publishing year. Also if user choose to
print current database content, program should print out to screen all information from
database, old and new information.
The visual user interface or printing out the database can be freely chosen, but should be
human readable format (new line feeds and some kind of separators are recommended).
